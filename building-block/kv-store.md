# KV Store

## Concept
* In-memory
  * Low latency direct access to memory
  * In-memory is an electronic device so no mechanical movement (electrical signals)
* On Disk
  * Mechanical movement leads to high latency for random access
  * Fragmentation worsens the problem further
 
## Real world
* Redis
* Memcached

# RAM

## 1a. What are the two types of RAM
* DRAM (dyannmic)
* SRAM (static)

## SRAM
### 2a. Trade offs of SRAM
Benefits
* Faster then DRAM
* Uses transistors so dont need automatic refresh

Challenges
* Uses more transisters than DRAM so costly
* Expensive
* Need constant power but less power than DRAM

### 2b. Where is SRAM used and why
Used in CPU caches as it expensive and faster

### 2c. What is the storage capacity of SRAM
1 MB to 16 MB

## DRAM
### 3a. What is the storage capacity of DRAM
64G GB
